                    We work closely with clinicians to understand the way they work.

                <p>
                    We make sure that we understand the context of the clinical service
                    they deliver, and what they need to support them in giving the
                    highest quality care. This means that our tools are designed to
                    work the way that clinicians think.

                    We use an agile development process - starting small

                    At every stage we gather feedback from
                    clinicians to help keep us on the right track. This process reduces
                    risk, and makes sure we end up with services that meet your needs.

                    improvements based on understanding what happens in the real world.

                <p>
                    We specialise in working with NHS institutions that deliver care. We
                    understand how to integrate with the other IT infrastructure you
                    already have in place. We have experience managing clinical risk for
                    software systems. We’re familiar with the Information governance
                    landscape, and we follow relevant standards and best practices.

            <p>
                Even though each clinical service is different, they often end up with
                overlapping needs. We’ve been there before and solved many common
                problems for our users, which means that we don’t need to charge you
                for solving them again.
            </p>
            <p>
                OPAL, our specialist software for developing applications for direct
                care, lets us build on that experience and expertise, meaning we can
                rapidly prototype and iterate.
