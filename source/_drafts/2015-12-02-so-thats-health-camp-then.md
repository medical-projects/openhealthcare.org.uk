Last weekend saw the first [Health Camp](http://ukhealthcamp.com/) in the UK for six years - and the first that weâ€™ve been involved in. 
It was a great event, and we enjoyed it hugely. We made tons of new friends, spent time asking the hard questions and
finding new allies as we work towards a health and care system that is truly of the internet age!

There were more sessions than we could get to - although https://twitter.com/nxtstop1 made an excellent storify summarising
the day https://storify.com/nxtstop1/the-fascinating-uk-healthcare-unconference-london- 

We enjoyed the Fix my hospital session - reminiscent of this nhshackday project from four years ago 
https://github.com/openhealthcare/nhsbugs 
but proving that the problem has not gone away yet.

Hospital systems need feedback loops, they need a focus on user needs, they need multidisciplinary teams that iterate
frequently.

We enjoyed the open source sustainability session

You can make sustainable open source projects in healthcare. We do it with OPAL and elCID.
