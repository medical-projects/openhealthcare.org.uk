We’re excited to announce that we’ve just released
[Opal](http://opal.openhealthcare.org.uk) 0.10.0.

With more than 450 commits from 8 authors, what’s new in this version?

## Windows support

This is the first Opal release to officially provide Windows support (more
details to follow) which we hope will be particularly helpful to developers
within the NHS looking to use Opal at work.

Although we don't actively develop Opal applications on the Windows platform,
we're now running all of our tests on Windows as a Pull Request
[status check](https://help.github.com/articles/about-required-status-checks/).
This gives us a minimum level of assurance going forwards that we're not
introducing things that cause issues, and a strong basis to investigate any
platform specific bugs that may get reported.

Particular thanks goes to the NHS Digital Innovation Fund for supporting
this work.

## Default reference data

As an Opal maintainer, one of the interesting things about attending
[NHS Hack Day](http://nhshackday.com) events is that it’s highly likely
that at least one team will be building their project on top of Opal.
That means that we frequently get to observe developers starting a journey
with Opal. Mostly they're creating new Opal applications and battle-testing
our project scaffolding, often they're also using the platform in anger for
the first time.

One of the things we’ve observed is that the step of importing or creating
clinical reference data for a new application is something that hasn’t always
been as slick as we’d like. (Until recently the
[tutorial](http://opal.openhealthcare.org.uk/docs/tutorial/) suggested running
`wget` on a bit of JSON on the internet and then feeding it into a database.)

This clashes with our batteries included design philosophy of optimising for
programmer happiness. With our wrappers around the Django `startproject` command
we try very hard to make the first hour of development exceptionally
productive — and this was obviously somewhere we could do better.

Starting withthis release, new Opal applications come with the module
`opal.core.referencedata` installed by default. This means for instance, that when
you open an ‘Ethnicity’ dropdown in a freshly scaffolded application, rather than
being an empty dropdown, you get the list of ethnicities from the
[NHS Data Dictionary](https://www.datadictionary.nhs.uk/data_dictionary/attributes/e/end/ethnic_category_code_de.asp).

## API enhancements

Most of the work that went into Opal 0.10.0 was focussed on enhancing the programming
API for building applications. New helper functions, new commandline options, and
other enhancements to improve the developer experience.

There are also lots of enhancements and expansions to our documentation to help
you along your way. You can read the
[full change log](https://github.com/openhealthcare/opal/blob/v0.10.0/CHANGELOG.md)
to get further details.

## What next ?

If you already have an Opal application we’d recommend you upgrade as soon as
you can. This release also requires an upgrade to a number of our upstream
dependencies and some Opal migrations. You can
[read our upgrade guide here](http://opal.openhealthcare.org.uk/docs/reference/upgrading/#091-0100),
and feel free to [post to the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?ohc-dev#!forum/ohc-opal)
if you run into issues with your upgrade.
