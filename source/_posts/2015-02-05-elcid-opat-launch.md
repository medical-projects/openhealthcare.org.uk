Last week saw us excited to launch our new [OPAT](http://e-opat.com/) (Outpatients
Parenteral Antimicrobial Therapy) service delivered via the [elCID](http://elcid.openhealthcare.org.uk)
platform at UCLH.

This is the first deployment of the specialist OPAT module for [OPAL](http://opal.openhealthcare.org.uk) -
our Open Source framework for building transactional digital services. It covers the whole range of an
OPAT service - from initial referrals and assessment, through ongoing care, post-treatment follow up and
review. All of the workflows capture high quality data at the time of use, and allow analysis and extraction,
both for reporting in line with national guidelines, and individual service audits.

As ever, we worked closely with clinical champions, who were deeply involved in the agile development process,
weighing in on [GitHub](https://github.com/openhealthcare/elcid/issues), attending sprint meetings, and
providing their expertise to our development team. The whole project is released under an Open Source (GPL)
license, and was developed in the open.


This was a project we loved delivering, and not just because of the high praise from Dr Jon Lambourne, UCLH's
clinical lead on the project, who said:

<blockquote class="custom-quote"><p><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>
The Open Health Care team have been super, the things they can get the OPAL software to do regularly leaves me slack-jawed!
</p></blockquote>

While we like to think that we're pretty good at executing on the technology side of things, it's really the collaboration
between us and the clinical users, along with our focus on their needs that makes it possible for us to deliver
new user-focussed digital services into the world.

Accordingly, we'd particularly like to thank
[Dr Sarah Logan](https://www.uclh.nhs.uk/OurServices/Consultants/Pages/DrSarahLogan.aspx) (Our consultant sponsor),
[Steve Collins](https://github.com/7575colli) (OPAT Nurse extraordinaire), and
[Dr Jon Lambourne](https://github.com/jonnylambourne) (Clinical lead on the project) for all their efforts.

If you're interested in seeing an OPAL project at your institution, or in seing how we can can
support running clinical OPAT services, don't hesitate to [Get in touch](/contact.html)!
