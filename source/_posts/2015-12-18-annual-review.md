2015 was a big year for us - so we thought we'd take a moment and share
some of what we've been up to:

# Delivering Digital Services for direct care

We believe that the digital tools used to deliver patient care should be of the highest
possible quality. Not only do we believe it, we work hard to deliver them as well!

Last year we launched two new services - for [managing OPAT care]({% post_url 2015-02-05-elcid-opat-launch %})
at UCLH (patients who need regular IV drugs but aren't so sick that they need to stay in
hospital all the time), and for the returning traveller
[walk in clinic]({% post_url 2015-10-21-launching-a-new-walk-in-service %}) at the Hospital for
Tropical Diseases.

We've also been working to iteratively improve the services we run - conducting user research
interviews, observing clinicians using our tools on the wards, and generally trying to establish
robust feedback loops and processes for users to tell us how we can make things better for them.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">From the wards yesterday: &#10;&#10;&quot;You&#39;re actually coming and asking doctors how you can make the IT systems they use better? - That&#39;s unheard of&quot;</p>&mdash; David Miller (@thatdavidmiller) <a href="https://twitter.com/thatdavidmiller/status/642247781617397760">September 11, 2015</a></blockquote>

Based on this research, we've made lots of improvements to the UI of our services, coming up
with new design patterns for building applications for direct care in the process.

# Code

Lots of this work invovles us writing, maintaining and improving code.

During 2014 We made 3 major [new releases]({% post_url 2015-11-13-opal-05-released %}) of
[OPAL](http://opal.openhealthcare.org.uk) - our framework
for building digital services for clnicians, not to mention many other smaller releases,
making up <b>2,416</b> individual commits across all
our [Open Source projects](https://github.com/openhealthcare).

Throughout the year we've been focussing on making our projects easier for new developers
to pick up - improving the [documentation](http://opal.openhealthcare.org.uk/docs) and
refactoring things to provide better APIs for people to build on.

# Hackdays

2015 was as busy as ever for [NHS Hack Day](http://nhshackday.com), with three
events bringing together hundreds of clinicians, academics, designers, developers, and
patients to help make the NHS just a little better.

We kicked off the year with another trip to [Cardiff]({% post_url 2015-05-25-nhs-hack-day-10 %}),
before coming back to London in May, and then heading up to Manchester in the Autumn.

# UK Health Camp

2015 also saw the first [UK Health Camp](http://ukhealthcamp.com) - a community unconference
for people interested in digital and data in health and care. We were proud to sponsor the
event, and glad to have a community space to discuss the pressing issues of digital transformation
within the NHS.

We're already looking forward to next year, and have started plotting how to make it even more
of a success with the rest of the team!

# The Future

Looking forward to to this year, we're excited to be working on lots of new projects, with new
partners, as well as continuing to develop and improve our existing services.

If you've got a project you think we could help with this year, do drop us a line at
<a href="mailto:hello@openhealthcare.org.uk">hello@openhealthcare.org.uk</a> - we'd love to
hear all about it!
