We're delighted to announce that NHS Hack Day is coming to Manchester on the 12-13 September. This is the first time we've taken the event
to Manchester, and we're all very excited to be doing so with the help of the super [Marcus Baw](http://twitter.com/marcus_baw)!

[NHS Hack Days](http://nhshackday.com) are weekend events that bring together "geeks who love the NHS" to have fun, build community, and work on digital projects that promote health.

The format is that we begin on a saturday morning with people pitching real-world problems they’ve encountered in the NHS or in health care generally. Anyone can pitch. We end on Sunday afternoon with a competition for the best solutions made over the weekend. In between people pick projects to work on, work on them, and have lunch (provided).

Previous NHS Hack Days have looked something like this:

### Why should I come to NHS Hack Day?

You’ll meet bright people from different disciplines you wouldn’t usually meet
You’ll play a part in making NHS IT less bad
You’ll have fun

We especially want people who aren’t sure if this is for them to come, a lot of the value of the event comes from the diversity of the participants, we need you!
