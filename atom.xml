    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At Open Health Care we believe in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine">Evidence Based Medicine</a>.</p>

<p>Which is why we create digital health <a href="https://github.com/openhealthcare/opal-research">services that support research</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the current infrastructure supporting evidence based medicine has some shortcomings. One of these is that
when a research paper is retracted because, for example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwang_Woo-suk">the author</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_misconduct">made up the results</a>, there is little or no means
to propogate this update in the wider medical literature.</p>

<p>Supposing, as a doctor, I look to a systematic review on the management of heart attacks to inform how I treat my patient,
I sadly have no assurance that the systematic review does not rely on research papers that have been retracted. This is suboptimal.</p>

<p>Open access, post-publication peer review, and better version control would be three useful features that a modern scientific
publishing model optimized to enable good science should support.</p>

<p>In the meantime, inspired by a lunchtime conversation with our friend and director Ben Goldacre (it was all his idea),
we pondered the question:</p>

<blockquote class="custom-quote"><p><i class="fa fa-question fa-3x"></i>
What is the most cited retracted paper?
</p></blockquote>


<p>It turns out <a href="http://www.pubmed.gov">PubMed</a> already has a nice API that can return a
<a href="http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esearch.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;retmode=json&amp;retmax=10000&amp;term=%22retracted%20publication%22">list</a>
of PubMed ids for papers that have been retracted. Next we needed a means of knowing how many times each retracted paper was cited.
There are a few ways of doing this but we went with using google scholar after Alf Eaton told us about it on
<a href="https://twitter.com/invisiblecomma/status/582904870644113408">twitter</a>. It&rsquo;s possible to search google scholar for the articles
citing a particular pubmed id, here&rsquo;s an <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19336536">example</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, we used wget to download all of the google scholar search results.  This infamous
<a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2897%2911096-0/abstract">paper</a> &lsquo;Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia,
non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children.&rsquo; was the winner with
2070 <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9500320">citations</a>!</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the top ten:</p>

<p>You can reproduce our results or view our workings <a href="https://github.com/davidmiller/retractions">over on Github</a>.</p>

<p>There are of course many reasons other than the author making up the results for a paper to be retracted. There are also many circumstances
in which citing a retracted paper is legitimate. For a more nuanced discussion of retractions there&rsquo;s a nice <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0044118">Comprehensive Survey of
Retracted Articles from the Scholarly Literature</a> in PLOS and the
excellent <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/">Retraction Watch</a> covers the details of individual retractions as they happen.</p>

<p>Anyway, it was fun to examine retractions. We&rsquo;d love to explore this further so if we can be of service to you do get in touch.</p>

<p>Perhaps a project for <a href="http://www.nhshackday.com">NHS Hack Day</a>?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://nhshackday.com">NHS Hack Days</a> are weekend events that bring together &ldquo;geeks who love the NHS&rdquo; to have fun, build community, and work on digital projects that promote health.</p>

<p>NHS Hack Day began in 2012 when Carl (a doctor) complained to his friend Tom (a developer) that things were really very broken in NHS IT. Tom who’d recently had a good experience at a Cabinet Office GDS Hack Day said the NHS should have a hack day. So we did.</p>

<p>The format is that we begin on a saturday morning with people pitching real-world problems they’ve encountered in the NHS or in health care generally. Anyone can pitch. We end on Sunday afternoon with a competition for the best solutions made over the weekend. In between people pick projects to work on, work on them, and have lunch (provided).</p>

<p>Previous NHS Hack Days have looked something like this:</p>

    <link href="http://openhealthcare.org.uk/blog/blog/2015/03/12/open-politics/"/>
    <updated>2015-03-12T15:42:20+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://openhealthcare.org.uk/blog/blog/2015/03/12/open-politics</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><i>This is a guest post by <a href="http://ntoll.org">Nicholas Tollervey</a></i></p>

<p>The purpose of this post is to explore openness in government
technology. I&rsquo;ve been asked to advise on this subject for
<a href="http://www.england.nhs.uk/">NHS England</a>.
I shall be directing the civil servants I have been working with to this
article.</p>

<p>To many people much of this post will be old news. Unfortunately
we are in the minority. Hence the need for this summary.</p>

<p>As always, feedback and comments are most welcome; in fact, comments
will be quite useful given the readership will include civil
servants who can make changes within NHS England. Think of it as an
unofficial opportunity for engagement with the unelected arm of the
government.</p>

<p>The moral argument for openness in government is simple: it is a
fundamental requirement for a democratic society. Without the ability to
observe what and how the government is doing, how are citizens to
evaluate politicians come polling day?</p>

<p>Yet openness is too broad a term - in this sense it is perhaps a virtue
of a good political system. Therefore I will simply state three
practical embodiments of the virtue of openness:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Open data</strong> - data should be freely available without restrictions of
copyright, patents or other controls;</li>
<li><strong>Open media</strong> - data generated by the government should be in a format
that is accessible to everyone;</li>
<li><strong>Open processes</strong> - what the government does should be transparent,
recorded and accountable.</li>
</ol>


<p>The UK Government has been
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-data-white-paper-unleashing-the-potential">vocal in the promotion of open data</a>
(point 1). Yet it is not good enough to simply publish data. The format
and structure of the data is critical (point 2), as is its provenance
(point 3).</p>

<p>Regarding point 2: what&rsquo;s the point of publishing data if there&rsquo;s no way
for people to make use of it? After all, when data is read, analysed and
interpreted it becomes useful information. Publishing data in a medium
that only works with a single piece of software (such as releasing
tabular data that can only be read by Excel) makes it frustratingly
difficult use. While I welcome the publication of data I&rsquo;d much
rather it were in a friendly open format (such as <a href="http://data.okfn.org/doc/csv">releasing tabular data
as a CSV</a>).</p>

<p>Regarding point 3: what&rsquo;s the point of publishing data if there&rsquo;s no way
to  discover how it was compiled, by whom and with what intention? It
should be possible to independently check the reports published by
government through access to the raw data and (crucially) the
algorithms, processes and pipelines used to aggregate, transform and
generate the end result. Furthermore, an open process allows people to
examine, test and improve the methodology involved in generating data.
It will no longer be the case that compiling some-report-or-other is
only understood by a couple of government statisticians - this essential
organisational information would be available to all.</p>

<p>While this sounds like an onerous task for civil servants it is
important to note that these three practices actually make life easier
for all involved, including civil servants.</p>

<p>From a technical point of view, it&rsquo;s impossible to work effectively in
digital walled gardens where opaque solutions don&rsquo;t quite work
properly and are too expensive to migrate away from. Open standards
allow anyone (including civil servants) the flexibility to use their own
choice of tool for the job in hand as illustrated by the diagram
below.</p>

<p><img
src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/8854/open_formats_standards_960x640.png"/></p>

<p>As the Cabinet Office minister <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-principles/open-standards-principles">Francis Maud states</a>,</p>

<blockquote class="custom-quote"><p><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>

Government IT must be open - open to the people and organisations that
use our services and open to any provider, regardless of their size.
<br />
We currently have many small, separate platforms operating across
disconnected departments and IT that is tied into monolithic contracts.
We need to have a platform for government that allows us to share
appropriate data effectively and that gives us flexibility and choice.
</p></blockquote>


<p>Contrast this vision with the incumbant alternative (based on real life
experiences working with statisticians within NHS England):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>No-one wants to work in a world where the data they need
for their report is held within a complex Excel spreadsheet with
meaningless column names generated by a team who never
answers email.</p></li>
<li><p>No-one wants to work with a spreadsheet that is subtly different each
time it gets published causing doubts about its reliability and
provenance.</p></li>
<li><p>No-one wants to work with a spreadsheet hosted on a website created in
2005 where the only way to get at it is to download a Java applet (the
technical equivalent of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozymandias">ruins of Ozymandias</a>
) and manually press a
button on a computer logged into the very special VPN that never works
when you need it to.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Such a chain of opaque technology comes at great cost in terms of
time, efficiency and job satisfaction. Highly trained NHS
statisticians do not enjoy spending hours downloading, revising,
copying, pasting and re-uploading shonky spreadsheets.</p>

<p>They want to <strong>work with data</strong>, not push it around.</p>

<p>They want to <strong>access the data</strong>, not spend hours clicking buttons.</p>

<p>They want to <strong>understand</strong> their colleagues&#8217; work and know who to contact
if there&rsquo;s a problem.</p>

<p><img src="http://openhealthcare.org.uk/blog/assets/images/posts/hope.jpg" /></p>

<p>Happily, there are signs of hope.</p>

<p>In the first instance civil servants should be following the
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-principles/open-standards-principles">Open Standards Principles</a>
from the Cabinet Office</p>

<p>It is a simple and easy to understand guide for using open
standards in government. If you&rsquo;re a civil servant working with data
you should be following this checklist:</p>

<ol>
<li>We place the needs of our users at the heart of our standards choices</li>
<li>Our selected open standards will enable suppliers to compete on alevel playing field</li>
<li>Our standards choices support flexibility and change</li>
<li>We adopt open standards that support sustainable cost</li>
<li>Our decisions about standards selection are well informed</li>
<li>We select open standards using fair and transparent processes</li>
<li>We are fair and transparent in the specification and implementation of open standards</li>
</ol>


<p>It is no longer acceptable to say things like, &ldquo;but the needs of our
legacy system mean you should use &lt;closed technology X&gt;&rdquo;. If you hear
such a remark, point the perpetrator at the checklist above. If they
claim it would be too expensive to migrate, explain that it&rsquo;s because it
is so expensive to migrate that such a system needs changing (such
expense only ever grows over time, change things sooner rather than
later). If they assert that it&rsquo;s not organisational policy to use
open process Y ask them to justify themselves within the framework
described in the policy document above (that became active on 1st
November 2012). Cabinet Office advice when
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/making-software/choosing-technology.html">choosing technologies</a>
is that one should express requirements in terms of user needs and capabilities
not incumbent institutional needs. Furthermore, when considering the choice
of technology, they state,</p>

<blockquote class="custom-quote"><p><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>
All things being equal, picking technologies that developers and operations staff like will typically result in improved productivity.
</blockquote>


<p>A second positive is that there appear to be politicians of all
affiliations who understand and have the political will to promote open
standards.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s hoping NHS England leads the way in open standards. After all,
they were born from a disparate collection of
existing governmental organisations, each of whom did things differently. Openness is
a way for NHS England to integrate, collaborate and work more effectively towards making
the NHS the world class healthcare system it needs to be.</p>

<p>This is an opportunity that applies to the whole public sector. The cost of inaction would
be to deny the government tools and processes essential for working effectively in a world
in constant flux.</p>

    <link href="http://openhealthcare.org.uk/blog/blog/2015/03/11/how-doctors-get-digital-services-they-love/"/>
    <updated>2015-03-11T21:12:19+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://openhealthcare.org.uk/blog/blog/2015/03/11/how-doctors-get-digital-services-they-love</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At Open Health Care, we believe in
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-centred-design">User-centered design</a>.</p>

<p>Which means that we focus on meeting the needs of our users, and is why we
always work in close collaboration with them. Whether that comes in the
form of making sure that our clinical champions are present at every sprint
meeting, or working hard to get clinical staff and patients along to
<a href="http://nhshackday.com">NHS Hack Day</a> we work by putting users first, building
and testing in small chunks.</p>

<p>Working this way means that generally when we work on a project, we identify
clinical champion(s) for that project. These are the kind of people who will use the service
we end up building in their day-to-day work. In order to get them as involved as
possible, we introduce them to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile">Agile</a>,
and we often find ourselves teaching <a href="https://github.com/GabPoll">doctors</a> to
<a href="https://github.com/michaeledwardmarks">github</a>. (Yes, that&rsquo;s a verb now).</p>

<p>The great thing about working in multidisciplinary teams, is that <em>everyone</em> learns
new things, all the time. For every medical three letter acronym like say,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community-acquired_pneumonia">CAP</a> that gets explained
to a developer, there&rsquo;s an explanation of what
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">API</a> stands for that goes the
other way.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s not just terminology that gets shared - often we try to share our tools. We
promote online
<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/docs/about/">collaborative</a>
<a href="http://hackpad.com/">document</a> editing above email attachments and
<a href="http://thedoghousediaries.com/5964">naming conventions</a>. We encourage users to take
up better web browsers. We get them to try out modern
<a href="https://slack.com/">team communication</a> <a href="http://appear.in">tools</a>, and recommend <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">Open Source</a>
alternatives to the proprietary default incumbents.</p>

<h3>But wait - it gets better</h3>

<p>Not only does this help us all understand one another better, which is so vital to delivering
high quality digital services, but it also often introduces clinicians to tools that reward
power users with advanced functionality. Once you&rsquo;ve learnt
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/">markdown</a> once, typing information
into text boxes that will get rendered in a web browser is never quite the same again. You start
<em>expecting</em> that the web based <a href="http://opal.openhealthcare.org.uk">clinical digital services</a>
you use in your day job let you <a href="https://github.com/openhealthcare/opal/blob/823de649ddee6c13803264d929ece3ae171104c5/opal/static/js/opal/opaldown.js">use markdown</a>
there too.</p>

<p>Possibly the best feature we&rsquo;ve implemented that came about this way is the
<a href="http://opal.openhealthcare.org.uk">OPAL </a>
Macros from
late last year. Directly inspired by <a href="https://github.com/blog/957-introducing-issue-mentions">Github issue mentions</a>,
OPAL Macros let the user define blocks of commonly used text, and then insert them with shortcut Macros -
(names preceded by the # symbol).</p>

<p>For instance, for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus">Staph</a> advice, the user enters #st:</p>

<p><img class="img-responsive" src="http://openhealthcare.org.uk/blog/assets/images/features/macro.pre.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>&hellip; which then expands to the (institutionally defined) standard advice for this case:</p>

<p><img class="img-responsive" src="http://openhealthcare.org.uk/blog/assets/images/features/macro.post.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is the kind of user need that only even comes up when users are digitally literate enough to
be able to express it - something along the lines of:</p>

<blockquote class="custom-quote"><p><i class="fa fa-user-md fa-3x"></i>
As a Doctor <br />
I want to avoid repeatedly typing out standard advice <br />
So that I can spend more time with my patients
</p></blockquote>


<p>The existence of this kind of power-user functionality encourages users to master their tools, by
offering them time savings and efficiencies but crucially, doesn&rsquo;t interfere with the user experience at all if you
don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s there. As
<a href="https://github.com/michaeledwardmarks">Dr Marks</a>, who had originally explained the need on
Github said:</p>

<blockquote class="custom-quote"><p><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>
Absolutely stunning.<br/>
I would say this is one of the most incredible things I have seen on a piece of NHS software ever.
</p></blockquote>


<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in starting an OPAL project at your institution to take advantage of this kind
of feature, or in seeing how we can can help you by providing clinical facing digital services,
don&rsquo;t hesitate to <a href="http://openhealthcare.org.uk/blog/contact.html">Get in touch</a>!</p>

    <link href="http://openhealthcare.org.uk/blog/blog/2015/02/05/elcid-opat-launch/"/>
    <updated>2015-02-05T09:12:19+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://openhealthcare.org.uk/blog/blog/2015/02/05/elcid-opat-launch</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week saw us excited to launch our new <a href="http://e-opat.com/">OPAT</a> (Outpatients
Parenteral Antimicrobial Therapy) service delivered via the <a href="http://elcid.openhealthcare.org.uk">elCID</a>
platform at UCLH.</p>

<p>This is the first deployment of the specialist OPAT module for <a href="http://opal.openhealthcare.org.uk">OPAL</a> -
our Open Source framework for building transactional digital services. It covers the whole range of an
OPAT service - from initial referrals and assessment, through ongoing care, post-treatment follow up and
review. All of the workflows capture high quality data at the time of use, and allow analysis and extraction,
both for reporting in line with national guidelines, and individual service audits.</p>

<p>As ever, we worked closely with clinical champions, who were deeply involved in the agile development process,
weighing in on <a href="https://github.com/openhealthcare/elcid/issues">GitHub</a>, attending sprint meetings, and
providing their expertise to our development team. The whole project is released under an Open Source (GPL)
license, and was developed in the open.</p>

<p>This was a project we loved delivering, and not just because of the high praise from Dr Jon Lambourne, UCLH&rsquo;s
clinical lead on the project, who said:</p>

<blockquote class="custom-quote"><p><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>
The Open Health Care team have been super, the things they can get the OPAL software to do regularly leaves me slack-jawed!
</p></blockquote>


<p>While we like to think that we&rsquo;re pretty good at executing on the technology side of things, it&rsquo;s really the collaboration
between us and the clinical users, along with our focus on their needs that makes it possible for us to deliver
new user-focussed digital services into the world.</p>

<p>Accordingly, we&rsquo;d particularly like to thank
<a href="https://www.uclh.nhs.uk/OurServices/Consultants/Pages/DrSarahLogan.aspx">Dr Sarah Logan</a> (Our consultant sponsor),
<a href="https://github.com/7575colli">Steve Collins</a> (OPAT Nurse extraordinaire), and
<a href="https://github.com/jonnylambourne">Dr Jon Lambourne</a> (Clinical lead on the project) for all their efforts.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in seeing an OPAL project at your institution, or in seing how we can can
support running clinical OPAT services, don&rsquo;t hesitate to <a href="http://openhealthcare.org.uk/blog/contact.html">Get in touch</a>!</p>

    <updated>2015-01-31T20:02:19+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://openhealthcare.org.uk/blog/blog/2015/01/31/nhs-hack-day-cardiff</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last weekend saw us return to Cardiff for the 9th NHS Hack Day - once again, with organisation
headed up by the life affirming <a href="https://twitter.com/amcunningham">Anne Marie Cunningham</a>.</p>

<p>NHS Hack Days are weekend events that bring together patients, healthcare and technology professionals and other
&ldquo;geeks who love the NHS&rdquo; under the banner of making NHS IT less bad. It&rsquo;s always exciting to see people discover
how digital products are made by &ldquo;Not Magic&rdquo;, not to mention the jaw-dropping that goes on when it gets explained
just how bad much of the status quo really is.</p>

<p>Many of the pitches highlighted the need for quickly and easily customisable hospital systems, that allow
people to collaborate more easily, and also to generate alerts and notifications, routing information that exists
within our institutions to the people who can actually make a difference with it, in time.</p>

<p>As the second day drew to a close, we all gathered together to share what we&rsquo;d made, and what we&rsquo;d learnt over
the weekend.</p>

<p>We thought that the team who rescued <a href="http://virtualmicroscope.readthedocs.org/en/hackday/">Virtual Microscope</a> -
a previously abandonned open source project for viewing, navigating &amp; annotate very high-resolution images deserved
huge credit.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the group that took the Oculus Rift and turned it into an eye-test scenario complete with zombies seemed
like they had a whole world of fun !</p>

<p>In the end the grand prize went to Medboard - a system for connecting medical students to the classes &amp; opportunities
available to them at their respective institutions.</p>

<p>In addition, we were delighted to see our youngest ever attendee to an NHS Hack Day, with Ada Reynolds stealing the record at just
5 weeks old! Although she may have slept through much of this one, we&rsquo;re all looking forward to her contributions next time !</p>

<p>Next time looks like being London in May 2015 - although the venue &amp; exact date are yet to be confirmed. We&rsquo;d love it
if you joined us though - so do <a href="http://nhshackday.com">sign up to the mailing list</a> to be kept in the loop !</p>

    <link href="http://openhealthcare.org.uk/blog/blog/2015/01/19/annual-review/"/>
    <updated>2015-01-19T15:00:29+00:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>OPAL at UCLH</h3>

<p>Early in the year we deployed <a href="http://elcid.openhealthcare.org.uk">elCID</a> - our custom built digital service for
infection doctors to University College London Hospital.</p>

<p>Despite our early plans for a cautious, staggered rollout, demand from end users to transition to the system meant
that we accelerated rapidly, spreading throughout the division of infection at UCLH and racing through the 1000 patient
mark within the few months.</p>

<p>Not content to sit on our laurels, we&rsquo;ve been further developing the platform, with a specialist OPAT (Outpatients
Parenteral Antimicrobial Therapy) service developed and launched early 2015, and a walk-in clinic service scheduled for
deployment in spring.</p>

<h3>OPAL for research</h3>

  <img class="img-responsive" src="http://openhealthcare.org.uk/blog/assets/images/posts/elcid.outputs.png" alt="" />
</div>


<!--//post-thumb-->


<p>2014 saw the first academic outputs from the OPAL project, with two posters presented at the
<a href="http://www.fis-infection.org.uk/">Federation of Infection Societies</a> conference.</p>

<p>Demonstrating the new capabilities for conducting clinical audits and exploring hypotheses about the patient
population treated by UCLH, concluding that:</p>

<pre><code>The electronic prospective data capture benefits of elCID have facilitated organisation
and interrogation of our own clinical practice to greater levels than before, describing 
many hitherto uncaptured elements of clinical activity.
</code></pre>

<h3>Hackdays</h3>

<p>2014 saw the <a href="http:/nhshackday.com">NHS Hack Day</a> train roll in to Cardiff, London and Leeds. As ever
the events saw us take multidisciplinary groups of Doctors, Technologists &amp; Patients for a weekend of
furious hacking, resulting not only in some great new projects, but in hundreds of individual opportunities
for people to connect &amp; learn from each other.</p>

<p>Particularly exciting were <a href="https://github.com/huwlynes/tb_care_plan">TB Care Plan</a> - a single page TB guideline
project that managed to take the rule of &ldquo;As simple as it can possibly be&rdquo; to new heights, and a
<a href="https://github.com/openhealthcare/opal-renal">Renal focussed</a> OPAL implementation for handover and patient management.</p>

<h3>The Future</h3>

<p>2014 has been a great year for Open Health Care, &amp; We&rsquo;re excited looking forward to the year to come !</p>

<p>With new product launches, lots of exciting projects in the pipeline, as well as the relentless programme of running
events up &amp; down the country, we&rsquo;ll be busy!</p>
